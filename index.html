    <h1>Creative Coding Projects</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to my collection of creative coding projects! This repository showcases my journey in exploring the intersection of creativity and technology through code.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Creative Coding?</h2>
    <p>Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional. It's often used in visual arts, music, and interactive experiences. While many creative coders use tools like <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, the only limit is your imagination!</p>
    
    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <p>Each week, I tackle a new prompt to inspire my creativity. Here are my projects so far:</p>
    
    <div class="project">
        <h3>Week 1: The Humble Dash</h3>
        <p>"In honor of our fallen comrade, today we shall honor the dash (not to be confused with Hyphen, Minus sign, or Hyphen-minus). The humble connector. We are disconnected. We are Split-brain. How shall we cross? Have we overreached?"</p>

        <h3>Week 3: Life Moves Fast</h3>
        <p>"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."</p>
