# Creative Coding

This repository is a collection of my creative coding projects. Each week, a prompt 
is given to inspire you to building something. Many people like to play around in
[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) but this is not at requirement.


## Week 1
> In honor of our fallen comrade, today we shall honor the dash (not to be confused with Hyphen, Minus sign, or Hyphen-minus). The humble connector. We are disconnected. We are Split-brain. How shall we cross? Have we overreached?

## Week 2
> My journey has always been the balance between chaos and order.
